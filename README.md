# learning-python

This repo was created to store the source code from Python programming books I've worked through. The majority of these resources encourage manually typing out the source code. This assists with grasping the technical concepts and understanding the code better. Additionally, I wanted a separate repo so I can access snippets of this code for future use, with the understanding that I am not the original creator of the scripts.
 
## List of books:
* Violent Python - TJ O'Connor
* Black Hat Python - Justin Seitz
* Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Al Sweigart
* Cracking Codes with Python - Al Sweigart

## Disclaimers:
* The Python version is dependent on the publication. If the book was written for Python 2.X I did not update the code to be compatible with Python 3.
* I encourage anyone trying to learn to type out the source code themselves. I learned a great amount from typing out and troubleshooting the code contained in this repo.
* The majority of the code has been tested, but there are some exceptions. Some of the examples require a specific OS versions or technologies that I did not spin up or purchase for obvious reasons. For example, purchasing test devices for Bluetooth sniffing - the price was not worth testing the short code snippet, so I simply punched in the code as it was laid out in the book.
